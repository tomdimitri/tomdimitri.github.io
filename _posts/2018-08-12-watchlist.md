### Portfolio Jekyll Theme

This is a Jekyll theme built using the [DevTips Starter Kit](http://devtipsstarterkit.com/) as a foundation for starting, and following closely the amazing tutorial by [Travis Neilson over at DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PL0CB3OvPhDA_STygmp3sDenx3UpdOMk7P). The purpose of this theme is to provide a clean and simple website for your portfolio. Emphasis is placed on your projects, which are shown front and center on the home page.

Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in [the repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme), which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/).

### Jekyll Starter Kit

The Jekyll Starter Kit is a simple framework for starting your own Jekyll project using all of the best practices that I learned from building my other Jekyll themes.

Feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/jekyll-starter-kit" target="_blank">the GitHub repository</a>, where you’ll also find instructions on how to use install and use the theme.
